So I bought a ginormous bottle and heavily dosed it that whole year. Then, I spent 2013 dealing with a lot of health issues /stomach related- and I can’t help but think that taking so much of those NSAIDs added to my health issues.🤦🏻‍♀️\n.\nThat tough health year helped me to learn so much about my body, and food & I started to take a totally different approach to health- basically focusing on using my diet to help decrease inflammation naturally- and to take herbs and supplements that would help the process along in a more natural way. I believe that medicine does have its place. But that there is SOOO much we can do to get the job done in a way that doesn’t create a domino effect of side effects (fix one problem, cause 10 more!)😑\n.\nI believe that if we eat right (think: whole foods & healing foods) & use the right herbs/supplements, we can work to help our body heal in a more natural way. Another benefit to doing things naturally- you don’t get the side effects that you get from taking pharmaceuticals. It helps to work with your body to heal.💜\n.\nMy #1 objective in how I eat / supplement is to help bring down the negative inflammation in my body. Turmeric & Omegas are one way I do that. I have been focusing on taking those while I’m getting my achilles better- anything that helps my body to continue to repair and heal.\n.\n@newchapterinc makes an amazing Fermented Turmeric that I love. 😍If your training has been heavy- adding this into your daily routine would definitely help with keeping your body recovering well. Fermented turmeric helps with inflammation & recovery- it’s a natural way to address your body’s inflammation after exercise. I love adding it to my morning protein shakes.\n.\nPS the code RUNFIT will get you $3 off their site, newchapter.com 💜\n.\n#newchaptervitamins #domore #run #ad #instarunners #marathons\nIdentify the hashtag that best represents this post.\nChoices: [#WinterSports, #TechInnovation, #SpaceExploration, #NaturalRecovery]\nConstraints: Choose only ONE hashtag, prefixed with #.",

Excited to learn what makes you smile and what your favorite foods are and what you do on your off days and curious how your kids are doing and excited to sit around a dinner table with you and talk about life and new adventures and places you would love to visit and even your heart breaks and what has built you and the journey you are on. People excited to love you. People excited to remind you that you belong.\nThose are real people. They may not be your current circle, but they exist. They fully exist and I am sure the person I just described is arms wide open to you.\n-\nAll too often I hear people talk about “giving up on humanity” and how they are choosing to “do me” because people are x,y and z. I refuse to accept those statements. I can’t. I have too much proof that we were created by love, in love, to love.\nHere is some advice, find a new circle. Find a circle that claps the loudest at your wins, that seeks to hear and know you. Find people who are not choosing to hold who you once were over your head as if it’s a life sentence. Find community that challenges you to grow.\n-\nYou are loved, today. As you are.

I mean cmon! This world is full of so much fun!!! I sometimes have to take all his toys away, shut off any music and just talk to him. When he locks eyes with me for even just two seconds, my heart explodes! Alexa relates this back to our walk with God. We are distracted by so much. So many \"things\" that in the moment feel way more important than God. Way bigger than God. Way easier than God! And when we are so far away from Him, He takes everything away so that our focus is directed back on Him. I want to raise Ocean to not let all these distractions take him away from his relationship with his family and most importantly God. But it has to start with me and MY relationship with God. It's so easy to get lost in \"things\" or in \"ourselves\". Today I promise to be more aware of when I'm losing my focus. We are called to love OTHERS. That's what it's all about.

Do you guys ever argue?”\n*Most commonly asked question in the TTH DM box 🙈\n\nThe answer is actually no. Of course we bicker, occasionally over silly things. H loads the dishwasher ‘all wrong’ and E spells things in the ‘strangest of ways’. These niggly things make us grouchy, but usually quickly solved with a Malteaser bunny, Spice Girls movie or some sweaty miles 💁🏼💁🏼 And yes, most of the time we are ‘happy’, but just like you we have grumpy days, grumpy miles and grumpy weeks. H sometimes needs nothing but her ‘Independent Ladies’ playlist, despite Em’s need to ramble and run. Sometimes Em’s just needs a night with Suits and scrambled eggs on toast (and beans obvs), even though H is desperate to discuss TTH plans for 2025 🙄 \nLiving, eating, working together helps us recognise what to say and when to say it. It also helps appreciate each other’s strengths, which we think is key to staying sweet. Knowing that we play different roles in making TTH the best it can be is what makes it work, making sure there’s no stepping on each others toes and meaning we can support eachother in the strongest possible way! Some may think running a business with their best friend would be a nightmare (sometimes it is 😜) but the fact we are simply spending the days doing what we love makes for two happy TTH’ers 💓 We motivates eachother to keep progressing with TTH and the messages we want to spread so today our #MondayMotivation is EACHOTHER!\n\nTag your BFFL below 👯‍♀👯‍♂ TTH x\n\n#twicethehealth👯 #TTHtalk #bestfriend #bestfriendgoals #bff\nWhich hashtag best encapsulates the essence of this post?\nChoices: [#SoloTravel, #CatLovers, #FriendshipGoals, #MountainClimbing]\nConstraints: Pick a single hashtag, ensuring it starts with #.",

I think the stress is making me more sensitive than usual and being a person who isn't very good at expressing or embracing emotions other than happy...I'm trying to not just bury it down deep this time or run away from it. I'm trying to acknowledge that it's normal and trying to allow myself to feel.  Have you ever felt like all your friends were invited to an exclusive party and you were purposefully not invited?  Left out.  This is not literal but I keep feeling this way.  Maybe it's my mind wondering if I'm good enough? Maybe in these moments of intensity I start to fear failure. Maybe the fear of failure makes me feel unwanted and unwelcome? I suppose that's why some people need a security blanket and to exist within a comfort zone.

We found fruit in the room left over from breakfast and she was able to eat it without getting nauseous. \nWhile the hotel's restaurant (which only serves breakfast) was surely closed, I headed downstairs to the front desk for some advice and assistance. \nAfter hearing that she was able to eat some fruit, they immediately asked which fruit to put together and quickly brought up this beautiful bowl filled with apples, plums, peaches, and pears. My wife ate a few and it helped her take some medicine - now with food in her system. \nAdditionally, the staff walked me and my son to the nearby pharmacy to ensure that we'd find it. \nThis is the kind of service that hospitality companies need to make for their guests, going above and beyond their needs and what is expected of them. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 #jerusalem #israel #ירושלים #ישראל #🇮🇱\nWhich of the following hashtag BEST describes this post?\nChoices: [#WinterSports, #CarReviews, #TechInnovation, #ExceptionalService]\nConstraints: only choose ONE hashtag from the Choice, and # should be included.",

Leute, ihr wisst gar nicht wie aufgeregt ich bin. Die liebe @jasna.jagar und ich haben wirklich unsere Idee, die „bei einer Flasche Wein“ entstand, umgesetzt und befinden uns auf der Zielgeraden! Das Buch, in dem es um das erste Jahr als Mama geht, ist gefüllt mit lustigen, ehrlichen und aus dem Leben geschriebenen Texten! Zusätzlich haben die Leserinnen die Möglichkeit, durch eigene Ergänzungen das Buch zu IHREM Buch werden zu lassen. Es kann an Mamas verschenkt werden, deren Kind knapp 1 Jahr alt ist oder man schenkt es sich einfach selbst :). Wer richtig verrückt drauf ist, liest es auch als Nicht-Mama😏. @theschlogger illustriert noch fleißig und dann geht es im Dezember in Druck, sodass es im Frühjahr 2019 erhältlich ist 😍. Ich freu mich sehr, dass ihr alles fleißig für das Cover abgestimmt habt und DANKE für das wundervolle Feedback! Hättet ihr schon ne Idee, wem ihr es schenken würdet 😁? P.s.
