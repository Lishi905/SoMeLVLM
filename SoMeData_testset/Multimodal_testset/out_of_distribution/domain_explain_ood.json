We have our passionate, gritty stories to tell‚Ä¶ stories that our very humanity depend on‚Ä¶ but our voices shake and we are paralyzed with fear over what that kind of vulnerability might evoke when we commit to words, breath, and space. The shame is so intense and brutal that just as we are about to unmask ourselves we pull our hand away with what our brains can only discern as certain death. The hardest vulnerability I have had to suffer is to be imperfect to my children. This has been the hardest part‚Ä¶ where my ego and my heart intersect. It has taken me a long time, but I have free fallen into motherhood. I let it sweep me up in the wind and twirl me around. I let go of my grip and I loosened my sway to it, but it catches me off guard in so many ways. I should be invincible, unstoppable, fearless, and full of conviction. Instead I am broken and unsure and incapable and without answers. I battle the worst voices within me to prove my worthiness to motherhood every day. I have to wade through the sadness of my humanness and profess my love as the anecdote to my extreme lack. I hope that somehow in between all of these flaws that they will forgive me and grow through that, up through the mud and bloom and find the light. And I hope they will always stand firmly planted in it. #realtalk #honestmotherhood . . . .\n\n#parenthoodvibes  #nestingly #mom_hub #inbeautyandchaos #momswithcameras #documentlife #ourhappynow #friyay #themotherhoodcorner #momstyle #weekendvibes #motherandchildren #instablogger #makeportraits #wearthem #mymotherhood #thatsdarling #darling #darlingmovement #hereandhow #documentyourdays #dailyparenting #momsofinstagram #motherhoodthroughinstagram #momlife #momlifeisthebestlife #ig_motherhood #flashesofdelight\nWhat is the user's professional field?

Well‚Ä¶ after further testing we recently learned that he‚Äôs also allergic to cow‚Äôs dairy AND PORK!!!!! üò±THE HORROR!üò´üò≠üò≠üò≠\n.\nBut, as close families do, we‚Äôre in this together! That means, when we eat at home, as a family, we‚Äôre all sticking to the same diet. \nWe don‚Äôt want him to feel alone in this food journey. (seriously, no pork? WTFüò≠)\n.\nOf course at events we‚Äôll cook what our clients want us to cook, and also continue some of the recipes we had planned for the blog. But at home, for our regular family meals, it will be different for awhile. .\nNow, our doc advised him to go off these three foods for at least 6 months, and then reintroduce them in very small quantities, to see if symptoms come back. So this isn‚Äôt necessarily a food death sentence. But it is a big deal for right now (as at least cow‚Äôs dairy and pork are a HUGE part of our diet and lifestyle). .\n.\nThat being said, we‚Äôre not giving up eating delicious, full flavored, foods anytime soon. We‚Äôre just learning to adapt. .\n.\nLike this steak. One of my favorite ways to cook a steak is to reverse sear it by smoking it at a low temp for about an hour and then finish it on a smokin‚Äô hot cast iron skillet with lots of butter and fresh herbs (like rosemary). Without the option of cow‚Äôs butter, we tested it out last night with goat‚Äôs milk butter. I was nervous, because goat‚Äôs butter has a very strong flavor. It‚Äôs very different from cow‚Äôs butter. .\n.\nBut guess what? The flavor did not overpower the steak, at all! In fact it was downright delicious! Not as rich and creamy in texture as the cow‚Äôs, but it certainly did the job well!\n.\n\nNow off to do more exploring. .\n.\nps, if you have any favorite dairy free substitutes I‚Äôd love to hear them! That‚Äôs been the hardest one for us so far. And pork. WHYYYYYYYYY?!?!?!?! üíî .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#NYstripsteak #nystrip #grilledsteak #grillporn #instabbq #glutenfree #dairyfree  #eeeeeats #bbqaddiction #nwbbqcrew #manmeatbbq #instabeef #makgrills #nwbbq #grillinfools #bbqnation #forkfeed #emberandvine #girlscangrill #vindulge\nWhat is the user's professional field?

One of them was gardening. My mom used to have us pull the weeds, make the holes in the ground, plant the seeds, water the plants, and collect the fruits, vegetables, and seeds. She obviously helped and did the big woman jobs that we couldn't do like preparing the ground, using the big tools, etc. At first I hated it but over the years I have grown to love it and have a passion for it. I saw the passion that my mom has for her gardens. The love she poured out into her flower beds. The nurturing care for each plant. Her careful sketches of her yard and garden designs noting down each flower placement, each bush, vegetable plant, tree, fruit bushes, you name it. Every little detail that she puts in to her yard showed her entire love and passion for gardening. Our home stood out amongst the best in colors and curb appeal. Her love started in Puerto Rico with my abuela (grandmother) who taught her just about everything she needs to know about cultivating the best fruits, the moon phases and how it affects our gardens to help nurish it and bloom stronger. She carries that with her till this day and I am proud to say that I am carrying it as well all thanks to her. Now I have my daughters help plant seeds and water our plants and hope to pass it on to them as well. üå±‚òâüåôüå≥üåª What is something that you are passionate about that would love to pass down to your children? üíö\n#gardening #greenthumb #aloe #plants #flowers #orchard #mother #daughter #familystories #childhood\nIn which area of work does the user specialize?
