Same movie, two different opinions. That hit me hard and is something I've been thinking a lot about lately.\n\nAll I can do is be 100%, unapologetically me, and people are not gonna like it. It's inevitable. And you better believe they're gonna tell me about it (behind their little smartphones of course). But that's OKAY, and letting go of caring is what will set all of us free. It's a burden that is so unnecessary to hold. It's better to be you and have people dislike you, than to be someone you're not and have people love you.\n\nNow, I'm a people pleaser at heart so you better believe this is VERY difficult for me. It's something that I've realized I never can stop practicing (letting go of caring). And I have to continually get better and better and it. So, as @actuallyitsaxel said yesterday, rule #1, f*ck what they think 💙.\n_____\nAs a side note, don't be surprised if I delete your rude comments. You're allowed to have them. Yes.

The first picture was shortly before I became pregnant with my first child, then me 36 weeks pregnant with Sage, and finally me 11 months postpartum. ☀️ I regularly receive messages from women who are hesitant to get pregnant or are anxious because they just found out they are pregnant but are already worried about their ability to \"bounce back\" and gaining excess weight. ☠️The fear that having a baby will ruin your body forever is a real and common concern of many women (thank you modern society 🙄). However that is not the end all predetermined destiny of a mother's body. Our bodies are amazing and specifically designed to grow and birth a child and then recover. It doesn't happen over night and you have to make conscientious decisions to eat healthy and exercise but it's possible! Post-babies my workout routine transitioned from gym workouts to home workouts and as a mother I naturally found myself eating healthier (only eating what I would want my kids to eat) plus frequent happy hours and Sunday fundays 🍾became a thing of the past. I've actually started each pregnancy smaller and more fit than one before. 💪🏼 So ladies have no fear, enjoy your healthy pregnancy and give your body appropriate time postpartum to recover. Continue to eat healthy, dedicate 30 mins a day to being active and you will be surprised when you look better post-baby than pre-baby! #transformation #fitmom #strongmom #veganmom\nIn which area of work does the user specialize?
