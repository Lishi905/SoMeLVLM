So we were up early like always prepping to head out, breakfast check, snackbox check, i drove to the kinder, dropped the younger one off, and then thought to hit the library for an hour or so till i had to take A to a playcentre for a playdate with school friends. Reached library only to realize it didnt open til 10ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Drove all the way back home to cook for a one-dish dinner party with friends later. Cooked under super-tight time constraints but was glad when friends declared it yummy. So then drove H to the playcentre, said hi to the mums, asked them if they could look after him for half an hour while i go fetch my younger one from kinder. Kinder pickup run and back to playcentre. Two hours spent trying not to lose my kid among the play jungle and chatting with mums. Went home for a quick hour or so to feed them lunch and prep for the swim class. Drove them to the swim class, handed them over to Daddy and drove back to fold up a load of laundry and get ready for the said dinner party. Night spent among lovely people laughing away and eating good food. Busy busy days in this stage of our lives but somehow they always make me thrive more. So i wanted to record it here.

This book was the easiest 5/5 I have given a book in a very very long time. It is easily in my top 5 favourite books. The characters are well developed and serve a purpose to the plot. They grow and learn, and to top it all off most are totally badass. And the female characters are great. The magic system is unique and well thought out - one of the best I have ever read. The plot is dense but not hard to grasp with twists and turns everywhere. If you're looking for an amazingly written story about stories for story lovers - this is it. (Also if you don't normally read fantasy - try this one! It's so much fun and not hard to follow.) Seriously: READ. THIS.

The suggestion of doing something that doesn't involve WiFi was met with rolled eyes (which I hate) but I insisted it would be fun. Within minutes the kite was up & Anya was actually nervously enjoying herself. That was until the kite got caught in a death spiral & hit the ground at Mach 2. Suddenly undoing multiple knots that sailors would struggle with, reeling the lines back in & piecing the kite back together didn't seem so appealing. I noticed the line went slack and the kite was off down the beach. Of course Anya had seen a couple of friend she's made & ditched me without a single goodbye. I guess flying a kite with your old man isn't all that cool anymore, especially when you have new international friends to impress. üò•üò≠ FYI watch out for instastories coming up - I'm finally going to use them, only for the next week though..... #brokenheartbrokenkite #istillhadfun #myarmlooksbrokenhere #dumpedfornewfriends #FatherofDaughters #fod #hoopersontour  #fod #dadlife #martinhal #destinology #luxuryholidays @destinologyholidays #familyholidays #portugal #sagres #algarve #instadad\nIdentify the hashtag that best represents this post.\nChoices: [#wintersports, #gourmetfood, #citybreak, #kiteflyingadventures]\nConstraints: Choose only ONE hashtag, prefixed with #.",

Il simbolo venerato non era dunque l‚Äôanimale, ma la sua pelliccia. I monaci la usavano per le pratiche tantriche, i capi trib√π per mostrare l‚Äôautorit√†, i funzionari tibetani per indicare il proprio status durante gli affari ufficiali.  In principio si usava la pelle scuoiata che poi divenne troppo difficile da reperire e fu sostituita dai tappeti tigre. \nIl disegno, che sia realista oppure astratto, rinvia intuitivamente a un qualcos‚Äôaltro, pi√π ampio ed ignoto, che possiede una forza di allusione capace di unire il piano orizzontale umano, a quello verticale spirituale, fondamentale in Tibet dove la via ordinaria non √® scindibile da quella trascendentale.
