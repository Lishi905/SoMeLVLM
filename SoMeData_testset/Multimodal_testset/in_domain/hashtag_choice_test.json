My parents divorce actually strengthened my marriage and taught me to be stronger than I would have ever imagined.

So we were up early like always prepping to head out, breakfast check, snackbox check, i drove to the kinder, dropped the younger one off, and then thought to hit the library for an hour or so till i had to take A to a playcentre for a playdate with school friends. Reached library only to realize it didnt open til 10🤦🏻‍♀️. Drove all the way back home to cook for a one-dish dinner party with friends later. Cooked under super-tight time constraints but was glad when friends declared it yummy. So then drove H to the playcentre, said hi to the mums, asked them if they could look after him for half an hour while i go fetch my younger one from kinder. Kinder pickup run and back to playcentre. Two hours spent trying not to lose my kid among the play jungle and chatting with mums. Went home for a quick hour or so to feed them lunch and prep for the swim class. Drove them to the swim class, handed them over to Daddy and drove back to fold up a load of laundry and get ready for the said dinner party. Night spent among lovely people laughing away and eating good food. Busy busy days in this stage of our lives but somehow they always make me thrive more. So i wanted to record it here.

I am a new found paper Pom Pom advocate. 🤣 2. Pick a colour theme! My theme was pink, white and gold! This was to match the cake (and because I'm having a little girl) but also because these colours go lovely together!! Then stick to the colour theme! 3. Do it your way, if you have a vision in your head, go with it! If you don't have a vision you can get some inspiration online! Pinterest is great for inspo!

I managed to settle up my machine and dig some fabric for a quick dress. 😉I have to confess I spend most of the morning procrastinating. ✂️Looking at the patterns and books; folding fabrics. Than I went into the zone and sewn the saiph dress from @papercutpatterns in a few hours. I used a gorgeous scuba from @tailormadeshop. I love winter florals. Added elasticated the sleeve hems because I like that detail on sleeves. I used contrasting pink top stitching. It's all zigzag ( the Janome zigzag is so neat that look like straight stitch). 🎉I'm wearing tomorrow. Our plans aren't very fancy. Me and the hubby are foodies; we are going to make pizzas from scratch and drink champagne. Maybe dancing on ceiling 🇧🇷Como é bom voltar a costurar. Passei a manhã namorando os moldes e tecido que tinha guardado. Eu quis fazer um vestido bem fácil de usar com uma estampa alegre mas quente. Eu acho tecido scuba bom só no inverno pq ele não transpira bem no calor.  Vou usá-lo no réveillon porque roupa branca não combina.

This book was the easiest 5/5 I have given a book in a very very long time. It is easily in my top 5 favourite books. The characters are well developed and serve a purpose to the plot. They grow and learn, and to top it all off most are totally badass. And the female characters are great. The magic system is unique and well thought out - one of the best I have ever read. The plot is dense but not hard to grasp with twists and turns everywhere. If you're looking for an amazingly written story about stories for story lovers - this is it. (Also if you don't normally read fantasy - try this one! It's so much fun and not hard to follow.) Seriously: READ. THIS.

Y me he acordado que estoy leyendo “A todos los chicos de los que me enamoré” que por cierto me esta encantando 😍😍😍 El caso que me he dicho, me apetece recomendar new adult 😊 y pues aquí estoy 😊 Este libro ME GUSTÓ MUCHIIISIMO! Es un new adult sobre dos hermanastros jajaja a mi estas historias que me van a gustar 😂😂😂😂 Las disfruto como una niña pequeña, no sé porque siempre me identifico con más protagonistas aunque la de este libro Edén, termino por desquiciarme, si es cierto que en el tercer libro ya cuando no la aguantaba pude entender un poco su comportamiento anterior viendo como lo estaba pasando de mal. En fin, que de verdad este libro es un enganche maximo y además pasa en Santa Mònica 😍😍 un destino el cual me muero por ir, hay millones de libros que se desarrollan en LA Y OMG LA EMOCIÓN 😍😍 sin duda si yo escribiera un libro pasaría allí 😊\n.\n.\n¿Me contáis que estáis leyendo?

The suggestion of doing something that doesn't involve WiFi was met with rolled eyes (which I hate) but I insisted it would be fun. Within minutes the kite was up & Anya was actually nervously enjoying herself. That was until the kite got caught in a death spiral & hit the ground at Mach 2. Suddenly undoing multiple knots that sailors would struggle with, reeling the lines back in & piecing the kite back together didn't seem so appealing. I noticed the line went slack and the kite was off down the beach. Of course Anya had seen a couple of friend she's made & ditched me without a single goodbye. I guess flying a kite with your old man isn't all that cool anymore, especially when you have new international friends to impress. 😥😭 FYI watch out for instastories coming up - I'm finally going to use them, only for the next week though..... #brokenheartbrokenkite #istillhadfun #myarmlooksbrokenhere #dumpedfornewfriends #FatherofDaughters #fod #hoopersontour  #fod #dadlife #martinhal #destinology #luxuryholidays @destinologyholidays #familyholidays #portugal #sagres #algarve #instadad\nIdentify the hashtag that best represents this post.\nChoices: [#wintersports, #gourmetfood, #citybreak, #kiteflyingadventures]\nConstraints: Choose only ONE hashtag, prefixed with #.",

The present  Boughton Hall was constructed in 1844 on the footprint of the original manor.  The present church was built on the site of a 14th Century Chantry and the ruined Church of St John the Baptist lies on the east side of Boughton Green.  Boughton Green Fair, reputed to be the biggest in the country was held here from 1351 until 1916.\n.\n📸: Captured by me @postcardsbyhannah\n.\nThe Parish is rich in archaeological remains, containing both Roman and Saxon sites and there are also two barrows, one at Bunkers Hill, the other at Boughton Grange.

Esta é uma das minhas melhores dicas do #nyc10orless relacionadas a transporte, então, presta atenção e já salva. O @ridewithvia é um aplicativo em que você compartilha corridas de carro com outras pessoas e paga um valor fixo por isso - US$ 5 ou US$ 7 por trajeto/pessoa. Isso é, para viagens em Manhattan até a rua 125th (as principais atrações turísticas da cidade estão incluídas). A diferença dele para um Uber Pool, por exemplo, é que o Via não te pega e deixa na porta, mas sim em uma esquina próxima, otimizando assim o trajeto e possibilitando promoções incríveis. Nessa semana você pode comprar o passe de viagens ilimitadas durante 7 dias por US$ 30! Sim, é mais barato que o passe do metrô! Esta oferta é válida até o dia 20 de  agosto, porém, mesmo o valor cheio dessa opção é uma boa pedida (US$ 63) já que sai menos de US$ 10 o dia (US$ 63). E esse passe ainda dá descontos ótimos para corridas até o Brooklyn e também para o aeroporto. Hoje eu paguei menos de US$ 4 para uma viagem até Williamsburg, no Brooklyn, e fui sozinha em um carro suuuper confortável. Ah! E se quiser ganhar de cara US$ 10 de crédito nele, é só colocar o meu código ao se cadastrar:  talita5j2 ;)\nWhich hashtag best encapsulates the essence of this post?\nChoices: [#MarathonTraining, #HomeDecor, #LuxuryDining, #BudgetTravel]\nConstraints: Pick a single hashtag, ensuring it starts with #.",

Il simbolo venerato non era dunque l’animale, ma la sua pelliccia. I monaci la usavano per le pratiche tantriche, i capi tribù per mostrare l’autorità, i funzionari tibetani per indicare il proprio status durante gli affari ufficiali.  In principio si usava la pelle scuoiata che poi divenne troppo difficile da reperire e fu sostituita dai tappeti tigre. \nIl disegno, che sia realista oppure astratto, rinvia intuitivamente a un qualcos’altro, più ampio ed ignoto, che possiede una forza di allusione capace di unire il piano orizzontale umano, a quello verticale spirituale, fondamentale in Tibet dove la via ordinaria non è scindibile da quella trascendentale.

It’s something that I work at every day. But, there I was laying in bed that night questioning myself and wondering why I wasn’t good enough. 💎\nEight months out and it’s never been more clear that I am good enough. I am whole all by myself and worthy of so much more. I come with happiness, passion,(and a little bit of sass), but when I look in the mirror, I like what I see. Now that my friends, is the ultimate #relationshipgoals 💎\nSo no matter what season of life you are in or what your relationship status is, I’m here to remind you to be YOU.
